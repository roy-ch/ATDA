# ATDA
ADTA: Adaptive Distance Training Algorithm for Randomized Smoothed Classifiers
Our proposed algorithm MACER outperforms all existing provably L2-defenses in both average certified radius and training speed on Cifar-10, ImageNet, MNIST and SVHN. Besides, our method does not depend on any specific attack strategy, which makes it substantially different from adversarial training. Our method is also scalable to modern deep neural networks on a wide range of real-world datasets.
